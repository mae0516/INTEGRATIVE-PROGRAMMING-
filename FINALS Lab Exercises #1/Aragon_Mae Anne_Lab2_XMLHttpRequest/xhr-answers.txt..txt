1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

   - readyState shows the current stage of the request (0 to 4).
     0 = not initialized
     1 = connection opened
     2 = request received
     3 = processing
     4 = done (response ready)

   - status shows the HTTP response code from the server.
     Example: 200 means OK, 404 means Not Found, 500 means Server Error.

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?

   - You can make it asynchronous by setting the third parameter of xhr.open() to true.
     Example: xhr.open("GET", "url", true);

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?

   - Because it keeps the webpage responsive. The user can still interact with the page
     while waiting for the server’s response, making the experience faster and smoother.
